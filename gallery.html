            <p><strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> was born on July 18, 1918 to the Thembu royal family in Muezo, British South Africa. 
        Mandela was best known for being a South African anti apartheid revolutionary.  
        Mandela was the first black man to become head of state, as well as the first to be elected in a democratic election.  
        His primary agenda was to erradicate apartheid by tackling institutional racism.  
        Mandela served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1991 - 1997.
        Nelson Mandela was a political leader and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.</p>

            <p>President Mandela studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand. 
        Mandela practiced law in Johannesburg and became involved in the anti-colonial and African nationalist politics.  
        He joined the ANC in 1943 and cofounded its youth league in 1944.  
        After the national parties white only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation whos only role was to benefit whites,
        Mandela along with the ANC committed themselves to the apartheids overthrow.</p>
               
            <p>After participating in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the people, mandela was arrested several times and was unsuccessfully
        prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial.  
        In 1962 Mandela was arrested for conspiracy to overthrow the state and that conviction rendered a harsh sentence of life in prison. 
        Mandela served 27 years of this term, mostly on Robben Island.  While he was imprisoned there was tremendous pressure both domestically and internationally 
        to release him.  
        It was only after the threat of civil war that he was released by F.W. de Klerk in 1990.  Mandela along with de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid. 
        Mandela orchatrated the 1994 multi-racial election where he emphasized reconciliation between the country's racial groups. This gave raise to the Truth 
        and Reconciliation Commission, which investigated human rights abuses.  Mandela's later years were spent combating Aids and poverty through his
        Nelson Mandela Foundation.</p>
